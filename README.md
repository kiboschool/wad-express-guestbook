## Guestbook in Express

Last week. we  created a functional digital guestbook in Flask. 

This week, we're going to switch to Javascript and recreate our  guestbook using Express.

This will not only help solidify your understanding of web application concepts but also introduce you to the similarities of different frameworks/languages.

**Getting Started**:

1. **Project Setup**:
    Clone this repository in your computer.

2. **Initialization & Dependencies**:
   Initialize a new Node.js project and install the necessary packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Building the Application**:
   Refer to the previously provided code to build your Express.js digital guestbook. Remember to set up the SQLite database, configure the Express app, define the routes, and create the necessary EJS template. All `GET` and `POST` should be sent to `/`.

5. **Running the Application**:
   Start your Express server:

   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

   Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to view and interact with your guestbook.

6. **Testing**:
   To run the tests:

   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

Happy coding!
